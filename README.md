**Stopwatch App Readme**

This project is a simple stopwatch web application that allows users to start, stop, and reset a timer. The app displays the elapsed time in minutes, seconds, and milliseconds format.

### How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. This will display the stopwatch app.

3. The stopwatch app will be shown in the center of the page. It has the following elements:
   - Display: Shows the elapsed time in the format `mm:ss:ms`.
   - Start/Stop Button: Click this button to start or stop the stopwatch.
   - Reset Button: Click this button to reset the stopwatch to zero.

4. To start the stopwatch, click the "Start" button. The timer will begin counting up from zero.

5. To pause the stopwatch, click the "Stop" button. The timer will freeze at the current elapsed time.

6. To resume the stopwatch from where it was paused, click the "Start" button again.

7. To reset the stopwatch to zero, click the "Reset" button. This will stop the timer and set the display back to `00:00:00`.
